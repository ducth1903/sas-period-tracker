When you have a period, it is important to take care of yourself *physically* and *mentally*. 

To help you be more comfortable, you can use different menstrual products that absorb the bleeding, such as pads and tampons. Some products such as cups collect the blood. It is important to record the dates your bleeding starts and ends to track changes from month to month. You may also have symptoms such as period cramps or headaches due to your changing hormones, and you can record those as well. This will help you predict when you will have future periods and how to take care of yourself during those times.
