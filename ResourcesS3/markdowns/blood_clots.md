Blood clots are blobs of blood and tissue that are usually smaller than a coin. These occur occasionally at the beginning of a period, and are bright red/dark red in color. You may want to see a doctor, however, if your blood clots are larger than a coin and occur too frequently, such as everyday of your period and in consecutive periods.
