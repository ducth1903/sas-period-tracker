An irregular period can be when your period lasts longer than 7 days, or when you menstruate too often (eg. more than once a month) or too little (eg. less than once a month).  

Periods can be very painful and challenging due to cramps or heavy bleeding, but shouldnâ€™t be so bad that it becomes difficult to do daily tasks during your entire period. 

The length of your menstrual cycle and period is impacted by stress, exercise, nutrition, health issues**,** and various other things. If your period is irregular for more than two months, please consult a doctor and together you can figure out if there is health issue.  

An abnormal period also may be when your period is so heavy that you find yourself needing to change your pad/tampon every hour or two, in which case**,** please consult your doctor.
