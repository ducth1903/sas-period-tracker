The menstrual cycle starts with the first day of each period. The cycle is controlled by chemicals called hormones, and goes through various stages to prepare the body for pregnancy.  

In the “ovulation” stage, the hormones estrogen and progesterone increase and tell the body to thicken the uterine lining. This will help support an egg in case pregnancy happens.  

In case pregnancy does not happen, estrogen and progesterone levels decrease. This **change** tells the body to release **both** the uterine lining and unfertilized egg as it wasn’t needed because pregnancy didn’t happen. The **lining and egg** come out through blood during your period.  

Due to changing hormone levels, you can experience many different symptoms throughout the cycle. An average cycle lasts between 24-38 days, but the length, and the symptoms you experience, can change with age.
