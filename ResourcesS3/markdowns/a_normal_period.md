A period normally lasts between 2-7 days. The bleeding can be the most heavy towards the beginning and gradually get lighter towards the end. On average, a person can lose 2-3 tablespoons of blood during a period, but it is fine to lose more or less as well.  

Due to hormonal changes, which are different for each person, other symptoms like acne, headaches, and mood swings can happen before bleeding starts. This is called premenstrual syndrome, abbreviated to PMS.  

Heaviness of bleeding, length of period, and other mental and physical health symptoms of PMS can differ with age, and with each person. Lots of factors can influence the regularity of your period, including stress, exercise, nutrition, illness, and medications (e.g., the use of birth control).
